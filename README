A C-learning project of mine: implementing playing cards and the logic to
evaluate a poker hand and compare two poker hands. It's a bit of a mashup
of different ideas on how to evaluate the hands, and isn't a great model of
a poker algorithm. But the main point is to give me some practice writing and
unit-testing C.
